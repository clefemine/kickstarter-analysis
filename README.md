Analysis: 
- Play campaigns that had a %50 or higher successful outcome had goals of less than $14999 and between $35000 to $44999. (See 'Outcomes Based on Goals' graph)
- Play campaigns that had a %50 or higher failed outcome had goals of $15000 to $34999 and $45000 or greater. (See 'Outcomes Based on Goals' graph)
- From our launch data analysis we can conclude that there is a trend of most successful outcomes for theater campaigns occur when launched in the months of May or June.(See 'Outcomes Based on Launch Dates' graph)
- The data is limited to launch dates and goal ranges, but finding out more information such as where the plays are most successful/failed/canceled can help campaign strategies. Analysis with information on when, where, and goal amount would give you more information on how to target play campaigns in individual countries. This would involve making data tables and graphs that show which countries have successful/failed/canceled outcomes then finding out the goal range for the countries successful/failed/canceled plays. Last, analyze launch dates successful/failed/canceled outcomes.
